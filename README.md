# RavenSLA
Open-source, SLA 3D printing. Expressly for biomimetics, prosthetics, and transhumanism prototyping. There are issues of
consistency, and laser safety due to the lack of protective side and top panels but these features can be added by 
anyone. The focus of this project was the algorithms which would allow for such a large scale galvanometer to work,
especially the distortion that would occur the further the galvanometer was from any single point on the bed, since the
same step would result in different distances.

\*this repository is no longer in development, hopefully in the future I will have time to completeley overhaul everything to be more consistent, stable, and configurable.

Please see report for now, regarding circuit diagrams and design untill they can be added here properly.
